# CryptoPay

CryptoPay is an iOS app that allows you to pay to a merchant using OST (Open Simple Token) backed branded ERC-20 tokens. You can signup on ost.com to stake your own BT tokens and then use the app to interact with the API.

The app uses QR-code to scan the ID of the merchant. It can be used to tokenize events like hackathons, buyin groceries, sports or pretty much anywhere.

The project was developed as part of OST Alpha Phase III Challenge. You can read more details about the project [here](https://medium.com/@shaistamirza).

**To use the app**
Simply download the project and run 'pod install' on the project. The project communicates with a web server that in turn interacts with OST APIs.
